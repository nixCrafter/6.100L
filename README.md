# MIT 6.100L: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

This repository contains my coursework for MIT's 6.100L, "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python". This course provides an introduction to computational problem-solving and Python programming.

## Coursework Structure

The repository is organized into problem sets, with each `ps` directory corresponding to a specific problem set from the course.

### Problem Set 0: Getting Started
- `ps0.py`: Introduction to Python basics.

### Problem Set 1: Control Flow and Functions
- `ps1a.py`: Calculating down payment for a house.
- `ps1b.py`: Calculating down payment with a semi-annual raise.
- `ps1c.py`: Finding the right savings rate using bisection search.

### Problem Set 2: Hangman
- `hangman.py`: A classic implementation of the word-guessing game, Hangman.
- `words.txt`: A list of words for the game.

### Problem Set 3: Document Distance
- `document_distance.py`: A program to calculate the "distance" between two text documents, a measure of their similarity.

### Problem Set 4: Permutations and Story Generation
- `ps4a.py`: Generating all permutations of a string.
- `ps4b.py`: Applying permutations to decrypt a story.
- `ps4c.py`: An object-oriented approach to decrypting the story.
- `story.txt`: The encrypted story.
- `words.txt`: A list of valid English words.
- `pads.txt`: The "pads" for decryption.

### Problem Set 5: Image Processing and Steganography
- `ps5.py`: A program for basic image processing and for hiding/revealing secret messages in images (steganography).
- Various `.png` and `.bmp` files for testing.
